        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                
            <li>3 large bananas, mashed</li>
                
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
                
            <li>1 egg</li>
                
            <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instruction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix bananas, sugar, egg, and melted butter in a separate large bowl until well combined; fold in flour mixture until smooth. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool briefly in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
